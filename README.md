# OCP-Enhanced-Tests
A test-Suite for testing OpenShift (OCP) in restricted setups.  

These tests will automatically test every OCP installation with regards to limited and/or restricted access via proxies, on some common hypervisors and "air-gapped".  
The results are intended as indicators and absolutely no warranty is promised or intended.   
So it will happen, that all tests run fine, but there still is a problem with the OCP installation tested. 

The software is "provided as is", we will never provide any support nor any warranty. All is best effort and we try our very best to make these test-suite as good as we can.  
But any user will use this "OCP-Enhanced-Tests" on his own risk and responsebility.  

You agree to this terms by downloading the software.
